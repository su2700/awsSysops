1.An Aurora cluster is set up for an online shopping site.
The shopping cart component uses a reader endpoint as its target for displaying the products. A System Administrator finds the ReplicaLag metric is high. What effect would a customer encounter?

1 Online shopping site would be very slow to respond

2 Items in the shopping site may intermittently not reflect the complete shopping list

3 Customer purchase order request would be delayed

4 Customer purchase order request would be slow and may time out
